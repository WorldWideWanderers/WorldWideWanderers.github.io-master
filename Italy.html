                      <p> Hey Emma here!  I recently took a trip to Italy.  In July and August you will find that these are the hottest months to visit, therefore if you are wanting to do more than just lie on the beach and do not want to go when it is too hot, May/June and September/October are still nice and warm but not too scorchio for you, plus the temperature is bearable when walking around sight-seeing.


                      The places I visited were Salerno, Poitano, Amalfi Coast and Rome
                      </p>

                     <h3> Getting There </h3>

                      <p> From the UK flights from all the main airports by the budget and main airlines fly into the various airports in Italy.  Watch out for special offers on flights, if you are flexible on dates and time of flight you will most likely pick a bargain.  Depending on your starting and arriving airport, your flight duration may be anything from 1.5 to 3 hours.
                      </p>

                     <h3>Getting Around</h3>

                      <p> If you are wanting to make the most of your trip and head to a few different places, getting around is very easy and pretty reasonable.  Italy has an excellent train network consisting of High Speed, Medium and Local trains.  Most of these have a First and Standard Class service which both are extremely comfortable and give a good level of leg room and seat size.  The high speed trains offer wifi and buffet facilities, to make the most of your journey.  The main train operators are <a href="http://www.trenitalia.com/"><img src="http://www.polrail.com/uploads/images/Loga%20przewoznikow/malelogo.jpg" width="42" height="42"/></a> and <a href="http://www.italotreno.it/"><img src="https://encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSiQU4ACYVePQCC5lu8MRQ1M6ysIAppqC_DcH3mjbrFY7DKdkDH" width="42" height="42"></a> Tickets can be purchased at the station on the day or via the web in advance (the further in advance the tickets are booked, the lower in cost they are).  If you are keeping to a budget and are considering a lower cost option to travel from the airport to your accommodation, for a small fee you can purchase a ticket (in advance, on the day and sometimes on the plane) for a shuttle bus such as <a href="http://www.terravision.eu/"><img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTinWoX7M4QwyOO5g65DIZJncUQXh98r6bRmly0NXsGmFSUthJD"/></a> that operate several times each hour and provide flexibility in case you experience flight delays. Alternatively, if you want to private transport, the airports are stocked with a good fleet of taxi’s to take you directly to your destination.  Just make sure you have some Euro's in your pocket!
                      </p>

                      <h2> Salerno </h2>

                      <img class="centred" src="Salerno.jpg" alt="Salerno" width="600px" height="400px" /> 
                     
                      <p> When people think of Italy, Salerno is probably not the first place they think of but it is a lovely province stretching the west coast of Italy very close to the Amalfi Coast.  The centre of Salerno is full of history, traditional restaurants, great bars, the town centre has lots of little streets filled with shops, a harbour (where you can take boat trips from) and several beaches along its coast line.

                      I was fortunate to stay with a good friend of mine and her dog Wally, so got a locals take on what to see and do while I stayed in Salerno.

                      </p>

                      <h3> Peasant Fest </h3>

                      <img class="centred" src="Peasant Fest.jpg" alt="Peasant Fest" width="500px" height="300px"/>

                      <p> On the first night my friend Mel suggest we go along to a food festival with some friends.  Over the summer there are lots of these “Peasant Fests” across the city which are pop up type gatherings whereby you are served a particular type of food (it could be anything from a traditional pasta dish to cake),whatever is local to the area.  It was a great way to bring local people and families together from different local communities to share food, good low cost wine and music.

                      On our particular night we had a home-made pasta dish with a chick pea sauce for 4 euros, a doughnut type of desert and good low cost wine 2.50e per bottle.  Bargain!  We were even able to keep our home made pottery bowls as a momento of the night.
                      </p>

                      <h3> Salerno Beach </h3>

                      <img class="centred" src="Beach.jpg" alt="Beach" width="500px" height="300px"/>

                       <p> Salerno has a very long coast line which consists of harbour, rocks and sand.  To get to some of the classic beaches, getting a taxi or hiring a car is advised.  This beach experience was completely different to at Positano.  I went to the Lido Ok beach which was a beach of sand, it was very open which meant we had a good sea breeze that made the sun rays more bearable.  At Ok Lido for lunch we had three plates to share fresh seafood in different forms (Octopus, Fried Prawns, Tuna).  The beach had both normal sun loungers and beds with parasol which you can pay at one off rate.  We had a good girly beach day out.   
                        </p>

                      <h3> Salerno At Night </h3>

                      <img class="centred" src="Pizza.jpg" alt="Pizza" width="450px" height="300px"/>

                     
                      <p>Salerno has a good selection of restaurants and bars (even an Irish bar) for enjoying a fun night out.   The Italians often start their evening at 10pm which is late compared to the UK therefore if you are wanting to experience a busy evening, definitely have a late afternoon siesta and then head out later in the evening.
                      </p>

                      <h2> Positano </h2>

                      <img class="centred" src="Potistana.jpg" alt="Positano" width="500px" height="300px"/>

                      <p> From the Marina area of salerno, Mel and I took a boat trip 1.5 hours round the bay to Positano which is famous for ceramics and lemons.  The ferry first of all stops off at Amalfi Coast for anyone wanting to visit there and then heads out again to the final destination of Positano.  From the see you experience lots of great views of the coast line, including houses and villas, restaurants and even the old watch towers that have been converted to houses that sit in the rocks.  The weather was exceptionally hot at 36 degrees so being on the boat with the lovely sea breeze made for a more pleasant trip.
                      Once we arrived in Positano we walked through the little lanes cobbled/tiled pathways where we found lots of restaurants, and shops (most air conditioned!).  The locals are very proud of their ceramics there were lots of lovely plates, bowls, tables on display with the trademark Lemon design.  Cake is a big thing over in Italy, and we went to a restaurant for (surprise surprise) Lemon cake!  They looked more like white boobs with berry nipples and I have never tasted something so light and creamy.  Deeeeelish!
                      Then it was time to hit the beach and get some rays.  In Potistana the beach is a pebble one, which in the heat made it even hotter, i literally felt like I was cooking on hot stone so I opted for shade and lots of water to re-hydrate me after no time at all.  Going into the sea while not burning my feet was a bit of a challenge and I was neither graceful or glamorous about it, put it this way, I was no competition to Halle Berry getting out of the sea in James Bond! Clumbsy and awkward  more like.
                      When it was time to catch the ferry back to Salerno, I was glad of the sea breeze again to cool me down.

                      <h2> Roma </h2>

                      <img class="centred" src="Rome.jpg" alt="Rome" width="500px" height="300px" />

                      <p> Getting to Rome was easy from Salerno, only a couple of hours on the train from Roma Termini railway station.

                      Rome has a very straightforward underground Metro system which was easy to navigate when getting around. It is so easy to get around by foot as well and you will discover little Piazza's and architechture just by stumbling on them accidentally.
                      </p>
                      <p> I've been lucky enough to have been to Rome a few years ago, but it was a flying visit and missed out on a few culture spots so this time I made it my priority to see Vatican City. 

                      <img src="http://www.papaboys.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Pietro2.jpg" alt="Vatican City" class="centred" width="500px" height="300px" />

                      Seeing pictures of Vatican City online does no way give it justice.  It's a huge part of Rome whereby along with being the Roman Catholic Church Headquarters where you will find the Pope, it is home to 11 Vatican Museums and the famous Michaelanelo's Sistine Chapel.  I word recommend if you are taking a trip to Rome, this is a must have place to see even if it is just to be in St.Peter's Square and see the Vatican from the outside. </p>
